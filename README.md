# win32-toolkit

This is a basic wrapper around bits of the Windows API. I put it together for setup and testing of
[https://github.com/bbredesen/go-vk](go-vk). It is mostly limited to the types, constants and functions that I needed to
get a window open and send window messages through to other Go programs. It is NOT inteded to be a broadly functional
Go wrapper around the Windows API.
